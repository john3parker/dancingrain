Confused when it comes to retirement savings? You're not alone. This article explains Roth IRAs, how they compare with other retirement accounts and how you can decide if a Roth IRA is right for you.

A Roth IRA could be a great option if you’re looking to supplement your employer-sponsored 401(k) — or if you don’t have one and need an alternative way to save for retirement.

### What Is a Roth IRA?

A Roth IRA is a tax-advantaged, retirement savings account that allows you to withdraw your savings tax-free. Established in 1997, it was named after William Roth, a former Delaware Senator. Roth IRAs are similar to traditional IRAs with biggest distinction between the two being how they’re taxed. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars; the contributions are not tax-deductible. But once you start withdrawing funds, the money is tax-free. Conversely, Traditional IRA deposits are generally made with pretax dollars; you usually get a tax deduction on your contribution and pay income tax when you withdraw the money from the account during retirement.

Unlike a 401(k), an IRA — whether it’s a Roth or traditional IRA — is an account you open on your own. It’s not affiliated with an employer.

What makes a Roth IRA unique is how the government taxes it. With a traditional IRA or 401(k), you put your money into the account before taxes are taken out. You’ll pay taxes on your contributions and earnings at the time of withdrawal. But because you’re investing money after you pay taxes with a Roth IRA, when you reach age 59 ½, you can withdraw your earnings tax-free.

Similar to other qualified retirement plan accounts, the money invested within the Roth IRA grows tax-free. However, a Roth is less restrictive than other accounts in several ways. Contributions can continue to be made at any age, as long as the account holder has earned income.3﻿ The account holder can maintain the Roth IRA indefinitely; there is no required minimum distribution during their lifetime, as there is with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.


### Funding A Roth

- Regular contributions
- Spousal IRA contributions
- Transfers
- Rollover contributions
- Conversions

All regular Roth IRA contributions must be made in cash (which includes checks); they can't be in the form of securities or assets. However, a variety of investment options exist within a Roth IRA, once the funds are contributed, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, ETFs, CDs, and money market funds.

The IRS limits how much can be deposited in any type of IRA, adjusting the amounts periodically. The contribution limits are the same for traditional and Roth IRAs.

### KEY TAKEAWAYS
- A Roth IRA is a special retirement account where you pay taxes on money going into your account and then all future withdrawals are tax-free.
- Roth IRAs are best when you think your taxes will be higher in retirement than they are right now.
- You can't contribute to a Roth IRA if you make too much money. In 2020, the limit for singles is $139,000. For married couples, the limit is $206,000.
- The amount you can contribute changes periodically. In 2020, the contribution limit is $6,000 a year unless you are over 50—in which case, you can deposit up to $7,000.
- Almost all brokerage ﬁrms, both physical and online, offer a Roth IRA. So do most banks and investment companies.
