The cost of a leaky faucet or a running toilet is more than just water lost. Water leaks can lead to high utility bills and even home damage.

## Bathroom in home showing potential water leak sites
Small, unseen water leaks in your apartment, condo or home can turn your water supply into a drip, drip, drip of additional expenses — and lead to significant water damage over time. In fact, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, household water leaks waste about 1 trillion gallons of water every year. Follow these tips to help protect your home from water damage.

## Check the water meter for a baseline
Your water meter can offer almost immediate insight into small water leaks in your home or rental unit. Here’s how: Turn off all water-using appliances and then check your meter to see if the flow indicator is moving. That may indicate a water leak. Alternatively, you can note the reading of the meter and then check back again after 10 to 60 minutes to see if it’s moved. If you’re not using water, but the meter has unexplained water usage, you’re losing water.

## Test the toilet
A running toilet can be a common culprit in cases of unexplained high water usage. According to some estimates, a toilet leak can cost you $1,000 or more every year. Since water leaks can be silent, you won’t necessarily know when you have one. To check yours, add a few drops of food coloring to the water in your toilet tank and then wait half an hour. If the water in the bowl changes color, you’ve got a leak. Common fixes may include replacing the rubber flapper in the tank.

## Investigate outside water use
Water leaks don’t only sprout indoors. Check your garden hose to make sure water isn’t seeping through at the connection point outside. If it is, replace the rubber hose gasket. Also, if you have an irrigation system, have it inspected once a year. Even a small water leak — the thickness of a dime — in an irrigation system can waste more than 6,000 gallons of water per month.

## Inspect every faucet
A slowly dripping faucet may not seem like much to worry about, but a faucet dripping at the rate of just one drop per second can waste more than 3,000 gallons of water per year. Typical leak causes include washers and gaskets that need repair.

## Consider a leak detector
Installed under sinks, near water heaters, underneath washing machines and near other water-using appliances, water detectors have gone high tech — many are equipped with a Wi-Fi that sends alerts to your phone if a leak is detected. Arm yourself with preventive tools to help save not only lost water, but lost money on utilities and water damage to your home.
