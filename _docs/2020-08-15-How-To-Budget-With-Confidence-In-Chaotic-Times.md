# Stop. Count to 10. Get Perspective. 
Think about what you really need to gain the right perspective. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has the entire world in an uproar. The media and news outlets are creating a frenzy and the misinformation keeps you confused about what's really going and can instill mass hysteria in many. This isn't a time to panic - it's time to take control. While this isn't a medical advice column we can give you common sense ways to approach handle your money. 


1. Take Care of the Essentials 
Food, Shelter, Utilities and Transportion - those are the esentials you need to make sure get paid each month. 

1. Debt Payoff
If you have other debt you've been trying to pay off, if you may want think about trimming those payments back to the minimums. Its a good method to conserve cash if your job future is uncertain. You can get back to paying off the debt when you're feeling comfortable wiht the job. Right now, cover the essentials only. 

1. Use your Emergency Fund
The emergency fund is there in case you need it. You've saved it for this exact situation! Use it when it's needed most, but only if you really need it. 

1. Use Savings as a Last Resort
Don't panic and allow yourself to dip onto your retirement savings. That means don't dip into your 401(k) unless there's absolutely no other way. As of 2019, if you are under the age of 59Â½, a withdrawal from a 401(k) is subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. You will also be required to pay normal income taxes on the withdrawn funds. For a $10,000 withdrawal, once all taxes and penalties are paid, you will only receive approximately $6,300.

1. Stay Healthy
Follow the CDC guidelines to keep yourself as healthy as possible. Each time you come home, Wash your hands thoroughly even if you feel like you've kept them clean. Use a mask when you're around other people. Try to not put yourself or your family at risk.
