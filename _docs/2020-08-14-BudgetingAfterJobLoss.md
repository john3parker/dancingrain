# How to Budget After a Job Loss
Have you job your job recently or had a pay cut? It happens. It can be a scary to not know when that next paycheck will come in. There is hope which is far greater than fear. These tips can help weather the storm to allow you take care of yourself and family. It's time to buckle down, make good decisions and spend wisely by budgeting through it. 

# Focus on the Priorities
If you already have a budget it's time to take a deeper look at it. If you don't, this is where you start. Focus on the priorities: food, shelter, utilities and transportation. You need to feed your family, keep a roof over your head (rent or mortgage) and keep the lights on (electric, water, gas, etc). These are your priorities now. 

# Trim the Fat
If you have other debt you've been trying to pay off, now would be a good time to trim those payments back to the minimums. You need to conserve cash. You'll get back to paying off the debt when you're back on you feet with a regular paycheck. Right now, cover the essentials only. 

This will be difficult but lower income means you have to lower your expenses. TUrn off the cable television or other streaming services with monthly charges. Check to see if you can lower your monthly cell phone bill. Plan to eat family meals at home to reduce your restrauant budget and streamline your groceries. You want to reduce your expenses to the essentials. Save as much cash as you can. 

# Find Ways to Make Money
Whether you lost your job entirely, furloughed or had your hours reduced resulting in reduced pay, it could be beneficial to look for other opportunities for income. Remain open minded and know its ok if you have to work two jobs for a while or take your career in a totally different direction. Some people have discovered opportunities like this afford them a better calling in life. Where some industries are struggling others are increasing! Make the best of an opportunity that comes your way. 

# Use your Emergency Fund
The emergency fund is there in case you need it. You've saved it for this exact situation! Use it when it's needed most. You can build it back up as you start to find ways to earn money again. 

Ask yourself three important questions before you use your emergency fund:

1. Is it unexpected?
2. Is it absolutely necessary?
3. Is it urgent?

Obviously, the extreme of this pandemic was unexpected. Covering your priorities is urgent. If you’ve done the other steps shown here and still struggling financially, then it’s necessary.

Make sure you budget whatever you take from your emergency fund as income. Why? That’s what you’re replacing right now. Job loss, pay cuts, emergency fund use—none of these things are an excuse to stop budgeting. They are actually all the more reason to budget! If you aren’t taking out as little from the emergency fund as you can, and treating it like income in your budget, you’re going to blow through all your savings and never even see it coming.

# Use Savings as a Last Resort
Don't panic and allow yourself to dip onto your retirement savings. That means don't dip into your 401(k) unless there's absolutely no other way. As of 2019, if you are under the age of 59½, a withdrawal from a 401(k) is subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty. You will also be required to pay normal income taxes on the withdrawn funds. For a $10,000 withdrawal, once all taxes and penalties are paid, you will only receive approximately $6,300.

It can be stressful to lose your job - lose your income. Don't let that stress you to the point you decide not to maintain a budget.
