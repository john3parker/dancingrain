### Benefits of a Roth IRA

1. It’s a Tax-Free Source of Income in Retirement
Because you’re paying taxes upfront, a Roth IRA is a good option if you expect to make significantly more money in the future. You’ll pay a lower rate on your income now than on your anticipated higher earnings later. On the other hand, many retirees live on a fixed income, so avoiding taxes could help out more than you think.

2. You Can Withdraw Your Roth IRA Contributions at Any Time
With a traditional IRA or 401(k), you’ll typically be taxed on your contributions and earnings if you withdraw money before age 59 ½. But because you’ve already paid taxes on your Roth IRA contributions, you can withdraw those tax-free whenever you need them.
However, if you withdraw from your earnings before you reach 59 ½, you’ll have to pay income tax on them, plus a 10% penalty.

3. You Don’t Have to Take Money Out
With a traditional IRA or 401(k), you’re required to take out a certain amount — known as a required minimum distribution (RMD) — once you reach age 70 1/2. The amount you’re required to withdraw depends on your age, your life expectancy and how much you have in your account.
But you’ll never have to take money out of your own Roth IRA. A Roth IRA has no RMDs while you’re still alive, though when you die, the beneficiary of your account may have to take them.

4. It’s an Option for People Who Don’t Have a 401(k)
You need earned income — such as a salary, hourly wages, bonuses, tips or self-employment income — to contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA. But because you open an IRA on your own, it’s a good way to save for retirement if you’re self-employed or your employer doesn’t offer a 401(k). You can also use it to supplement your employer-provided 401(k).
If you want to invest money you’ve already paid taxes on, ask if your employer offers a Roth 401(k), which you also fund with after-tax dollars and later withdraw tax-free in retirement.

5. You Can Use a Roth IRA for a First-Time Home Purchase
You can withdraw up to $10,000 worth of earnings ($20,000 for married couples) from your Roth IRA penalty-free to help pay for a first-time home purchase if you’ve had the account for five years or more. You can also use your Roth for College Expenses. You can withdraw earnings penalty-free if you use the funds to pay for college or other higher education — for yourself, your child or your spouse — though you’d still have to pay income taxes in this circumstance.

7. It Offers a Safety Net
You might be able to use Roth IRA funds to pay for medical expenses that exceed more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income, or to pay for your health insurance premiums if you’ve claimed unemployment compensation for more than 12 consecutive weeks.
If you become permanently disabled, you can also use the money from your Roth IRA to help with your expenses.

8. There Are No Age Limits
With a traditional IRA, you can’t make contributions once you reach age 70 ½, but there is no age limit for contributing to a Roth IRA.

### Disadvantages of a Roth IRA
While there are many benefits to opening a Roth IRA, there are also some disadvantages to consider. Here are a few.

1. You Don’t Get an Up-front Tax Break
Unlike a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA doesn’t reduce your taxable income, so you wind up paying more in taxes now. Your tax break comes when you reach retirement age.

2. You Can Only Contribute $6,000 a Year if You’re Under 50
The amount you can contribute to an IRA typically changes each year. For 2019, you can deposit a maximum of $6,000 in an IRA — a Roth, traditional or both. If you choose a traditional and a Roth IRA, your contribution limit is $6,000 total, so it’s up to you to decide how to distribute that money between your accounts.
That limit goes up to $7,000 once you’re 50 or older, allowing you to contribute faster to your retirement fund.

3. You Can’t Contribute to a Roth IRA if Your Income Is Too High
The IRS adjusts the income requirements each year. For tax year 2019, you must make less than $122,000 annually as a single tax filer to contribute the full amount. From there, the amount you can contribute phases out. If you make more than $137,000, you aren’t eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA.
If you are married filing jointly, your contribution limit starts to go down if your combined income is over $193,000, and you’re ineligible if your income is over $203,000.

4. You Have to Set It Up on Your Own
Unlike a 401(k), which your employer sets up for you, a Roth IRA is an account you open on your own, so you have to do your own research about what to invest in or get help from a financial adviser.
