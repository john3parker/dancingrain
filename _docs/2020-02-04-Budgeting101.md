# Start Budgeting Now
 
The new year is about reflecting on the past and working toward new goals in the future. This applies to your budget and all your money goals too! Your past budgets—with every success and slipup—are what you build future budgets on. See what worked and what didn’t. Use that knowledge as the power to move forward.

Here are the budgeting basics
- Savings
Saving money is a no-brainer. Learning how to save money takes time and discipline. Start your budget right with an Emergency Fund for those "emergencies" that can pop up to create disruption in your budgeting cycle: car repair, unexpected medical bills, etc. Once you have your emergency fund ready, put money away for retirement in a 401K, [Roth IRA](/retirement/RothIRA.html) or investment account. 

- Giving
Contributing to someone else's well being can certainly make you feel better about your life. However, before you give big to your favorite charity make sure you have your own finances in order. 

- Housing
One of the most important budgeting items on your list is housing. This includes paying the monthly bills for mortgage/rent, water, natural gas/propane and electricity. You may also have television/Internet services, trash pickup and other housing expenses (POA fees, lawn care, etc.) 

- Transportation
There are significant costs if you own a vehicle. Payment, fuel and maintenance are the top ones to consider. Don't forget about parking fees and bus passes! 

- Food
No matter if you're a carinore or vegan you need to feed your family. Groceries, school lunches and restaurants should all be considered. 

- Personal
This is a catch-all bucket for those monthly expenses you like to have but don't necessiarly need. New clothes, cell phone, hair/nail/cosmetic visits, subscriptions (magazines, XBox Live, etc.)

- Lifestyle
Everyone has a different way of living their life. Child and pet care could fall into this category as well as entertainment (movies, theatre, etc.)

- Health
It's important to take care of your health. Make sure to budget your monthly gym fees, medicine, vitamins and doctor visits. 

- Insurance
There are many different types of insurance you can have. You may not need all these: health insurance, life insurance, auto insurance, homeowners/renter insurance, identify theft. 

- Debt
Almost every American has some form of debt, and you need to plan how to pay the money you've borrowed. MOney you own someone comes in many forms: credit cards, car payment, student loans, medical bills, personal loans, mortgage. 


As you’re making new goals for all areas of life, be sure to make room in the budget! Don’t forget these January budget items as you make that first budget of the new year.
